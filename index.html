            <p>I got my very first job when I was thirteen. After completing a training
                course, I began refereeing soccer games for the local children's league. 
                This is still quite possibly the worst job I've ever had. Some parents take
                their children's sports far too seriously...

            <p>Refereeing didn't last long, and I soon moved on to the local orchard. 
                Every Autumn they held a big Fall Festival, with a pumpkin patch, hay-rides,
                game booths, apple-picking, and a haunted house. I was on the staff for this 
                and spent most of my time running the hay-bale maze, the apple slingshot, 
                and the scarecrow-making booth. I enjoyed working outside and getting a weekly 
                paycheck as a middle-schooler was great, as were the apple-cider doughnuts 
                I ate all Fall!

            <p>When I turned 16, I got my first year-round job working as a stock clerk 
                at the liquor store my neighbor owned. I worked on "Beer Crew" at the store, 
                which is one of the largest in the country. My duties included stocking 
                shelves and coolers, answering customer questions, and moving cases 
                and kegs to customers' cars. I worked here all throughout high school and 
                came back a couple times between college semesters. I moved to cashier after 
                I turned 18, and preferred that to the manual labor of "Beer Crew," though I 
                did miss the tips I would get for doing "Carry-Outs" to customers cars.

                I spent the Summer after my Freshman year of college working at a W.L. Gore 
                factory. The company makes a variety of products, but the area I worked in produced
                cables for missiles and rocket ships. Even though I was hired as a worker in 
                the stockroom, I was made to sign a government waiver saying I would not tell 
                anyone outside of the plant about what I did at work. After a couple weeks of 
                filling orders for 100's of O-rings and other tiny parts, I was moved to the 
                "Clean Room," where workers produced cables in a sterile enviornment, wearing 
                lab coats and gloves. I much preferred soldering and using lazers to cut wire 
                jackets over the tedious, boring work of the stockroom.

            <p>After Sophomore year of college, I was hired by a friend's dad who owned a Heating
                and Air-Conditioning business. I installed duct systems in new houses and installed 
                new furnaces/AC-units in customers' homes. I decided to take a semester off from 
                school that Fall and worked with the company for about 8 months. I returned to work 
                for the company between semesters, as well as for a time after graduation. While I did 
                hate working in 110-degree attics and dirty, musty crawl spaces, I learned so many 
                useful skills on this job, like carpentry, electric, and plumbing. Also, the friend 
                whose dad I worked for soon became my girlfriend, and eventually became my wife!

                <p>After my semester off, I transferred to a college in the midwest. While attending 
                    school there, I was hired by the campus' dining hall as a dishwasher. My roommate 
                    and I worked the same dishwashing shift for a time, which made the work more fun. 
                    Eventually I was asked to start serving food, then immediately moved to the grill, 
                    where I cooked burgers, grilled cheese sandwiches, chicken strips, and french fries 
                    as diners ordered. This job (thankfully) didn't last too long, as a better opportunity 
                    soon presented itself.

            <p>While taking Studio Recording classes in college, my professor asked me to 
                work as a manager for the school's recording studios. I was happy to leave 
                my job in the dining hall and work in an environment I really enjoyed. I was 
                charged with managing the studio-time schedule, letting students into the 
                studios for their scheduled times, checking out microphones and other equipment, 
                and assisting students when they needed help with projects. I was also asked to
                re-wire the main studio after renovations were complete. This job gave me extra 
                practice in my area of study, and I was thrilled to have this opportunity.

            <p>After graduation, my then-fiance and I moved to Saint Louis. I got a job 
                with a non-profit organization that assisted people with developmental 
                disabilities. I worked as support staff in the home of six disabled men. 
                This remains one of the most rewarding, and one of the most challenging 
                experiences of my life. The men were often very grateful for the assistance 
                and I formed friendships with most of them. I got to take residents to the 
                movies, restaurants, and sporting events. There were also very hard times, 
                however, like when a resident would get angry or violent, or when someone 
                required assistance in the bathroom. I worked here for over a year, until 
                I was offered a job that paid much better.

            <p>While working in the group home, I was offered a job running sound at a brand 
                new bar owned by a fellow alumni of my college. I started doing this on the 
                side as a night job a couple nights a week. I set up microphones and ran the 
                sound board for live concerts. Again, I loved working in this field and getting 
                more experience. The downside, however, was that I sat through a lot of terrible 
                sets by inexperienced local bands.

            <p>After a few months of running live sound at the bar/venue, the owner/operators 
                decided to hire their first bartender. I told them I was interested, 
                and soon began learning the trade. It was a good fit, and I've now been working 
                behind bars for eight years. I've since bounced around a bit, and worked at 
                a variety of types of establishments, from South City dives, to tourist-y bars 
                at the beach, to fancy cocktail bars. I've had a knowledge of and appreciation for 
                alcohol since working at the liquor store in high school, and I've also really 
                enjoyed the social aspect of bartending. I've made many good friends through my time 
                bartending, and I will certainly miss it when I move on.

                look forward to starting a career in programming. I've been flying through 
                the course-work, and I actually look forward to getting back to work on 
                my assignments. I think this industry is an excellent fit for me, and I 
                sometimes wish I had applied to LaunchCode years ago. I look forward to 
                continuing to learn and getting a job I can love for years to come.
